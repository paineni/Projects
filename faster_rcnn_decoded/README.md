This repository provides a **step-by-step breakdown of the Faster R-CNN architecture**, focusing on understanding its components and functionality without training the model. The implementation is built using **PyTorch** and demonstrates the inner workings of Faster R-CNN, including **anchor generation**, **Region Proposal Networks (RPN)**, and **Fast R-CNN**.

## üìö Key Features

- **Decoding Faster R-CNN**: A detailed walkthrough of the architecture, from feature extraction to region proposals and final object detection.
- **Anchor Box Generation**: Visualize how anchors are generated and mapped to the original image.
- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: Understand how proposals are generated and filtered using IoU and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).
- **Fast R-CNN**: Explore how proposals are classified and refined into final detections.
- **Visualization**: Includes utilities to visualize feature maps, anchor boxes, region proposals, and final detections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Overview

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Uses the **Penn-Fudan Pedestrian Dataset** for demonstration.
   - Masks are converted into bounding boxes for visualization.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Backbone: **VGG16** is used to extract feature maps from input images.
   - Feature maps are processed to generate anchors and proposals.

3. **Anchor Box Generation**:
   - Anchors are generated for each feature map pixel with 9 configurations (3 scales √ó 3 aspect ratios).
   - Invalid anchors (outside the image) are filtered out.

4. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**:
   - Predicts objectness scores and bounding box offsets for anchors.
   - Applies **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** to reduce redundant proposals.

5. **Fast R-CNN**:
   - Refines proposals and classifies objects.
   - Uses **ROI Pooling** to extract fixed-size feature maps for each proposal.

6. **Loss Functions (Explained)**:
   - **RPN Loss**: Combines classification (object vs. background) and regression (bounding box offsets).
   - **Fast R-CNN Loss**: Combines classification (object classes) and regression (bounding box refinement).

7. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize anchor boxes, proposals, and final detections.
