## 🚀 Overview

This MATLAB script processes climate data for Surface Solar Radiation Downwards (SSRD) and Average Surface Temp (AST), visualizing the data through various transformations. It creates animations, contour maps, and 3D visualizations of the climate data, allowing dynamic and interactive exploration of solar radiation and surface temperature patterns.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Climate Data Visualization** (2D, 3D, animated)
- **Time-series animation** of SSRD and AST data
- **Contour Maps** for solar radiation and surface temperature patterns
- **Interactive Maps** with geographical plotting

## 💻 Requirements

- **MATLAB (R2020b or later)**
- **Toolboxes**: Mapping Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- **NetCDF Files**: Climate data in `.nc` format (e.g., SSRD data)

## 🔧 Steps to Install MATLAB

1. Visit the [MATLAB Download page](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
2. Install MATLAB and required toolboxes for data manipulation and visualization.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Prepare Data**: Save climate data in the required NetCDF format inside the `data` folder.
2. **Run Script**: Execute the provided MATLAB script for SSRD analysis and visualization.
3. **View Plots**: Explore 2D, 3D, animated, and contour visualizations for climate data.

## 📊 Outputs

- **3D Climate Visualization**: Solar radiation data and average surface temperature visualized in 3D.
- **Animated Time-Series**: Yearly climate data presented in dynamic animations.
- **Geographic Contour Map**: Display radiation across geographical regions.
