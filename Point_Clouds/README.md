## 🚀 Overview
This MATLAB script processes a 3D point cloud by applying **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, translating, and rotating the data. It visualizes the point cloud in 3D, projects it to 2D, and evaluates the variation to identify optimal transformations.

## 🛠️ Features
- **PCA** for principal components and axis transformation
- **Translation** and **Rotation** of the point cloud
- **2D Projection** of the transformed cloud
- **Variance Analysis** for optimal alignment
- **Interactive Visualization** of results

## 💻 Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020b or later)
- Input file: `Point_Clouds.xlsx` with 3D coordinates in columns A to C

## 🔧 Steps to Install MATLAB
1. Visit [MATLAB Download](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/) to get the latest version.
2. Install MATLAB following the provided instructions.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary toolboxes (like PCA and plotting libraries).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Prepare Data**: Save your 3D point cloud data in `Point_Clouds.xlsx` (columns A to C).
2. **Run Script**: Execute the provided MATLAB script to perform PCA, translation, and rotation operations.
3. **View Plots**: Review the output plots for transformations and variance analysis.

## 📊 Outputs
- **3D Point Cloud**: Original and transformed visualizations.
- **Variance Plot**: Identifies optimal transformation.
- **2D Projection**: Distance of points to the z-axis.
