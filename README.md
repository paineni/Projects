In this project, I developed deep learning models for the optical inspection of printed flat panels. I utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a VGG16 architecture, modifying it to extract features up to the first fully connected layer (fc1). To simulate real-world scenarios, I augmented the dataset with artificially created defects. Finally, I trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the final classifier to distinguish between good and defective images based on the extracted features.

In this project, I thoroughly studied and decoded the Faster R-CNN architecture. I delved into the original research paper, meticulously breaking down the step-by-step implementation process. This involved understanding the underlying concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of the Faster R-CNN for object detection.

This end-to-end project involved various steps, including data preprocessing, model initialization, training, and evaluation. A custom-created FiftyOne dataset was utilized, and a Detectron2 model from the model zoo was initialized. The project seamlessly integrated with FiftyOne, enabling smooth handling of ground truth annotations, **model training**, prediction loading, and **performance evaluation**. Additionally, FiftyOne was used for comprehensive data analysis, such as identifying **duplicate samples**, **visualizing embeddings**, and other critical functionalities for **data curation**.

In this project, I focused on visualizing climate data to facilitate a deeper understanding of climate change impacts. I created interactive visualizations, including 2D animated GIFs and 2D/3D contour plots, to explore and present climate data in engaging and immersive ways. These visualizations were designed to be accessible and informative, particularly for younger audiences, and aimed to enhance cross-functional collaboration by optimizing visual data for better integration with computer vision solutions. By employing visually compelling representations, I aimed to improve communication and comprehension of complex climate phenomena.

In this project, I used MATLAB to apply machine learning techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and geometric transformations to identify the axis direction in an incomplete point cloud. I developed a novel hit-and-trial criterion for estimating the axis location, leading to precise alignment and enhanced estimation accuracy. This approach, incorporating both PCA and geometric transformations, significantly improved the interpretation and alignment of point cloud data.

In this project, I implemented the YOLOv1 (You Only Look Once) architecture with a VGG-based model for object detection. The system is designed to identify and classify objects in images in a single pass, significantly improving the accuracy of the detected classes. I trained the model on various datasets, fine-tuning the VGG architecture to enhance the feature extraction process for object localization and classification in real-time applications.
