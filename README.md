In this project, I developed deep learning models for the optical inspection of printed flat panels. I utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a VGG16 architecture, modifying it to extract features up to the first fully connected layer (fc1). To simulate real-world scenarios, I augmented the dataset with artificially created defects. Finally, I trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the final classifier to distinguish between good and defective images based on the extracted features.

In this project, I thoroughly studied and decoded the Faster R-CNN architecture. I delved into the original research paper, meticulously breaking down the step-by-step implementation process. This involved understanding the underlying concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of the Faster R-CNN for object detection.

This end-to-end project involved various steps, including data preprocessing, model initialization, training, and evaluation. A custom-created FiftyOne dataset was utilized, and a Detectron2 model from the model zoo was initialized. The project seamlessly integrated with FiftyOne, enabling smooth handling of ground truth annotations, **model training**, prediction loading, and **performance evaluation**. Additionally, FiftyOne was used for comprehensive data analysis, such as identifying **duplicate samples**, **visualizing embeddings**, and other critical functionalities for **data curation**.

In this project, I focused on visualizing climate data to facilitate a deeper understanding of climate change impacts. I created interactive visualizations, including 2D animated GIFs and 2D/3D contour plots, to explore and present climate data in engaging and immersive ways. These visualizations were designed to be accessible and informative, particularly for younger audiences, and aimed to enhance cross-functional collaboration by optimizing visual data for better integration with computer vision solutions. By employing visually compelling representations, I aimed to improve communication and comprehension of complex climate phenomena.

In this project, I used MATLAB to apply machine learning techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and geometric transformations to identify the axis direction in an incomplete point cloud. I developed a novel hit-and-trial criterion for estimating the axis location, leading to precise alignment and enhanced estimation accuracy. This approach, incorporating both PCA and geometric transformations, significantly improved the interpretation and alignment of point cloud data.

In this interdisciplinary project, which blends mechanical and electrical engineering principles, I focused on the real-time detection and regulation of chatter vibrations in milling operations. Utilizing multimodal vibration sensors and advanced signal processing filters, I enhanced machining reliability by effectively monitoring and identifying chatter. The project involved a thorough evaluation of filtering methods to pinpoint the most effective technology for real-time chatter detection and mitigation, integrating concepts from vibrations and signal processing within the realm of mechatronics.
